# How to Build and Run Aurora Grid

## Step 1: Open in Xcode
```bash
cd /Users/jade/Wiistrument-Development/01-Active-Projects/Rosita-Project/source-code/wiistruments-center-clean/aurora-grid-ios
open AuroraGrid.xcodeproj
```

## Step 2: Fix Initial Setup Issues
When Xcode opens, you'll likely see errors. Here's how to fix them:

1. **Add all Swift files to the project:**
   - Right-click on the project navigator
   - Select "Add Files to AuroraGrid..."
   - Navigate to the Sources/AuroraGrid folder
   - Select ALL .swift files
   - Make sure "Copy items if needed" is unchecked
   - Click "Add"

2. **Set up Package Dependencies:**
   - Click on the project name in navigator
   - Go to "Package Dependencies" tab
   - Click "+" to add AudioKit
   - Enter: https://github.com/AudioKit/AudioKit.git
   - Version: Up to Next Major 5.6.0
   - Click "Add Package"

3. **Configure Build Settings:**
   - Select the AuroraGrid target
   - Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
   - Select your Team (or use Personal Team)
   - Bundle Identifier should be: com.jadewii.auroragrid

## Step 3: Build and Run
1. Select your device (simulator or real device)
2. Press Cmd+B to build
3. If build succeeds, press Cmd+R to run

## Common Issues You Might Face:

### "No such module 'AudioKit'"
- Make sure you added the AudioKit package dependency as described above

### "Cannot find type 'X' in scope"
- Make sure all Swift files are added to the project target

### Build errors about missing files
- The .xcodeproj file I created is minimal - you need to add all source files manually

## What You Should See When It Works:
- Landscape-only app
- Pink gradient background
- 6 drum tracks with 16 steps each
- Play button starts the sequencer
- Tapping grid cells activates/deactivates steps
- BPM slider changes tempo
- Pattern buttons switch between 4 patterns
- Knobs control effects and sound parameters

## If It Doesn't Work:
The app structure is there, but iOS development requires proper Xcode configuration. You might want to:
1. Create a fresh Xcode project with SwiftUI
2. Copy the Swift files into it
3. Add AudioKit via Swift Package Manager
4. Configure Info.plist settings
